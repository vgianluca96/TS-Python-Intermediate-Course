    "## Exercise: Modeling Students and Schools with Python Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create a Python class called `Student` and enhance it step-by-step to learn about **class attributes**, **instance attributes**, **instance methods**, and **class methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the `Student` class:**\n",
    "   - Create a class named `Student`.\n",
    "   - Add an `__init__` method to initialize a student's name and age as instance attributes (`self.name` and `self.age`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add a Class Attribute:**\n",
    "   - Introduce a class attribute named `school_name` with the value `\"Python High School\"`.\n",
    "   - Understand that a class attribute is shared by all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Instance Methods:**\n",
    "   - Create a method called `display` that prints the student's name, age, and school name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add a Method to Check Age:**\n",
    "   - Define a method called `is_minor` that returns `True` if the student's age is less than 18, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add a Method to Update the Name:**\n",
    "   - Write a method named `update_name` that allows changing the name of a student instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Add a Class Method:**\n",
    "   - Implement a class method called `change_school_name` that changes the value of `school_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test the Class:**\n",
    "   - Write a script to test the `Student` class:\n",
    "     - Create three students with different names and ages.\n",
    "     - Display their details using the `display` method.\n",
    "     - Check if each student is a minor using the `is_minor` method.\n",
    "     - Update the name of one student using `update_name` and display the updated details.\n",
    "     - Use the `change_school_name` method to change the school name and confirm it reflects for all students by displaying their details again.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of the Exercise\n",
    "- Understand the difference between **instance attributes** and **class attributes**.\n",
    "- Learn how to define and use **instance methods** and **class methods**.\n",
    "- Practice creating and interacting with class instances.\n",
    "- Observe the impact of changing class attributes on all instances.\n",

    "## Exercise: Applying OOP Principles with Students and Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will enhance your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by applying the principles of **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**. You will build on the `Student` class from the previous exercise and modify it to incorporate these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 1: Encapsulation**\n",
    "1. Create a new class `SecureStudent` that:\n",
    "   - Encapsulates the `name`, `age`, and `grades` attributes as **private** (use double underscores `__`).\n",
    "   - Provides methods `get_info` to retrieve student information and `add_grade` to safely add a grade to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test the encapsulation by:\n",
    "   - Instantiating a `SecureStudent` object.\n",
    "   - Printing the studentâ€™s information using `get_info`.\n",
    "   - Adding a grade using `add_grade` and confirming the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: Inheritance and Polymorphism**\n",
    "1. Create a subclass `GraduateStudent` that inherits from `SecureStudent`.\n",
    "   - Override the `get_info` method to indicate that the student is a graduate student (e.g., return `Graduate Student: ...` instead of `Student: ...`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instantiate a `GraduateStudent` and confirm that the overridden `get_info` works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Abstraction**\n",
    "1. Introduce an abstract class `Person`:\n",
    "   - Add an abstract method `get_info`.\n",
    "   - Make `SecureStudent` and `GraduateStudent` subclasses of `Person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test the abstraction by ensuring that all subclasses implement the `get_info` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 4: Class and Static Methods**\n",
    "1. Add a class method to `SecureStudent`:\n",
    "   - Create a **class attribute** `school_policy` with a default value (e.g., `\"Follow academic integrity\"`).\n",
    "   - Add a `set_policy` class method to update the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a static method to `SecureStudent`:\n",
    "   - Define a method `calculate_average` that takes a list of grades and returns the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test these methods:\n",
    "   - Access and modify the `school_policy` using the class methods.\n",
    "   - Use `calculate_average` to compute the average of a list of grades.\n",
